# hello-world
This is a repository for performing the "Hello World" GitHub guide.

My name is Alex and, I must admit, this whole GitHub thing is kinda exciting. I've always enjoyed getting more into coding/technology and this Comm Lab project has been a great excuse (not to mention a procrastination tactic). I enjoy playing soccer, golf, and doing things outdoors whenever I can (ironic that I live in Boston when I love nature so much).
